## Info related to me:
**Name**  *Dor Bismuth*

**email**  *dor.bismut@gmail.com*

:point_left:
## Info related to the app:
*This is an native Android app written in Java.*

*App built using Android Studio build 2020.3.1 and java version 1.8.0_301*

*The main idea of this project is to parse [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)* API
*with different approaches.*
:newspaper:
## Notes:

**Screen size compatibility**  *I made a couple tweaks on the UI which may display differently across*

*variety of other android devices and emulators ( I might be wrong tho ) and Iev tested it successfully on my*

*smasung A50 running Android 11 and on my emulator Pixel 2 API 30*


**Actionbar**  *MovieActivity extends  YouTubeBaseActivity which doesnot seem to have an action bar,*

*but I did made a practice using it on MainActivity where it shows which selection mode is selected.*

**Why I added an youtube view**  *I thought that it might be a cool extra , even if not really requested besides*

*the fact that AppCompatActivity cannot be extended and action bar is not part of it I think it cant make*

*any worse since I have used action bar on the MainActivity and also added some sort of actionbar to MovieActivity.*

### Libraries that I used and why:
**[okhttp](https://square.github.io)**  *used to retrieve youtbe's video link from the raw api*

**[YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/downloads)**  *This libary is needed inorder to have a youtubeview.*

**[retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)**  *My rest client for handling the API calls.*

**[picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/)**  *Used to load images form a url to a view*

**[androidx.recyclerview](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview)**  *Better when fetching large sets of data also minimizing memory usage.*
